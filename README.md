# Norwegian Government OpSec 

## Transparency Through Passive Observation and Publicly Available Information

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of publicly available information regarding Norwegian government agencies' entire digital infrastructure. All data contained herein has been legally obtained through passive monitoring techniques, public metadata, and other publicly available information.  

It also functions as a resource for the public to gain better insight into the devices used by different agencies. For example, the Norwegian Police have long denied having bodycams available, claiming this as the reason they don't use them. This repository will prove this claim to be completely false.  

Hopefully, this will assist people in certain cases with specific agencies and in particular situations.

### Project Mission:

My mission is to aggregate, systematize, analyze, run pattern recognition, perform correlation studies, synthesize, and finally present information that is already accessible to the public, albeit scattered across various sources, some very difficult to locate. By consolidating this data, I aim to:

1. Increase transparency around various government agencies' digital infrastructure, especially wireless technology and IoT devices that are becoming dangerously prevalent
2. Educate the public about wireless security "best practices"
3. Document patterns in government technology deployment
4. Promote responsible disclosure and security awareness, as this is information everyone should know, including the dangers lurking in this high-usage environment

**Note:** This repository will **NEVER** under any circumstances contain information obtained through illegal means. All data is collected through either passive monitoring, publicly available sources, or other legal methods.

### What You'll Find Here

#### Network Infrastructure Data:
- MAC address collections from various government agencies, categorized by county and department
- Wireless access point identifiers and their distribution patterns
- Client device fingerprints observed through passive monitoring
- Public metadata analysis from network communications
- Temporal patterns of network activity in public spaces

#### Radio Frequency Observations:
- Legally monitored radio frequency data from public broadcasts
- Equipment signatures detected through passive scanning
- Metadata analysis of public communications
- Temporal and geographical distribution of radio activity

#### Educational Resources:
- Tutorials on passive monitoring techniques
- Explanations of MAC address structure and organizational identifiers
- Guides to understanding government technology deployments
- Case studies on public infrastructure security

### Practical Applications:

This repository enables researchers, security professionals, and concerned citizens to:

- Create detection systems for specific agency equipment based on known MAC OUIs
- Develop alerting mechanisms for the presence of particular government devices
- Study the evolution of government technology infrastructure over time
- Analyze the security implications of current deployment practices, especially the new high volume usage of unsecured IoT devices in different agencies

It's particularly concerning that the Norwegian Police purchase equipment without thorough verification of internal components. For all they know, these devices could be backdoored before delivery, creating significant security vulnerabilities.

### Legal Framework:

All information in this repository adheres strictly to Norwegian law regarding:

- Passive monitoring (no transmission or interference of any kind have been performed)
- Public information access
- Radio communications monitoring of public broadcasts from several various goverment agencies

I explicitly prohibit:
- Contribution of illegally obtained information
- Data gathered through network intrusion of any kind, or by proxy
- Information obtained through deceptive practices

As a former government employee as a network system administrator in one municipality, and one in another county, I do not condone any illegal action against any of the government agencies. I do not condone performing any task that is illegal in Norway.
Don't be stupid, it's not worth it.

### Current Status & Roadmap:

This project is in its early stages. I am actively:

- Expanding my dataset of publicly observed MAC addresses
- Refining my metadata analysis methodologies
- Developing visualization tools for the collected data
- Creating educational resources about my findings
- Exploring additional related areas for investigation

### Contributing:

I welcome contributions that align with my legal and ethical framework. If you have legally obtained information about Norwegian government agencies' network infrastructure that you'd like to share, please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.

**Important:** All submissions undergo rigorous verification to ensure they were truly obtained through legal means. I reserve the right to reject any contributions and to redact any sensitive/personal information that does not meet my standards or raises legal concerns.

### Disclaimer:

This project exists for educational and research purposes only. The information provided should not be used for **ANY** illegal activity whatsoever, or to compromise government agencies' operations. I advocate for responsible use of this knowledge to improve security awareness and practices.

The maintainer of this repository is not responsible for how others might use this information. Please use this data ethically and legally.
